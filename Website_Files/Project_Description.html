      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32" class = "PD_text">When faced with the task of taking medicine, it can be hard to do so correctly, especially with how complicated medicine labels can be. This can lead to providing an incorrect dose of medicine for yourself or 
	  others, which can be very dangerous, especially for children. The knowledge of correct medicine dosing and many other concepts is encompassed by the field of health literacy. Health Literacy is the degree to which people can find and use information to 
	  make better health decisions for themselves and others. Health literacy is especially a problem for parents of young children, and these parents find it difficult to care for their children and administer medications properly and with the correct frequency 
	  and dosage. The objective of the HealthLit project is to increase the health literacy of parents of young children through the spread of proper information. This information will be reinforced by interactive games and activities to ensure that the 
	  information is absorbed properly. Our team wants to ensure that all parents can properly access the information that will help them care for their young children.
