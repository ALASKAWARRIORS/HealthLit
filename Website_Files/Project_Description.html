		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p>
		When faced with the task of taking medicine, it can be hard to do so correctly, especially with how complicated medicine labels can be. This can lead to providing an incorrect dose of medicine for yourself or others, which can be very dangerous, 
		especially for children. The knowledge of correct medicine dosing and many other concepts is encompassed by the field of health literacy. Health Literacy is the degree to which people can find and use information to make better health decisions for 
		themselves and others. Health literacy is especially a problem for parents of young children, and these parents find it difficult to care for their children and administer medications properly and with the correct frequency and dosage.
		</p>
		
		<p><br>
		Looking at how to address this problem, we realized that there is one thing that most parents have access to: a smartphone. Our solution is to create a mobile app designed around increasing the health literacy of parents. This app will provide access 
		to interactive modules that parents can complete to educate themselves about child health. We will include modules such as determining the correct dose of medication for a specific child given their weight, tracking expected growth milestones for 
		children ages one to five as well as access to digital versions of credible health information resources that a parent might expect to find at a doctorâ€™s office. Parents will be able to create accounts with an email and password to save and track their 
		progress through these activities, so busier parents can progress at their own pace. Our goal -- as well as the goal of our client -- is to effectively disseminate accurate information and increase the health literacy of parents of young children so 
		that they can provide better care.
