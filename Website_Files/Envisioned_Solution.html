      <h1>Our Solution</h1>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">Looking at how to address this problem, we realized that there is one thing that most parents have access to: a smartphone. Our solution is to create a mobile app designed around increasing the health literacy of parents. This app 
	  will provide access to interactive modules that parents can complete to educate themselves about child health. We will include modules such as determining the correct dose of medication for a specific child given their weight, tracking expected growth 
	  milestones for children ages one to five as well as access to digital versions of credible health information resources that a parent might expect to find at a doctorâ€™s office. Parents will be able to create accounts with an email and password to save 
	  and track their progress through these activities, so busier parents can progress at their own pace. Our goal - as well as the goal of our client - is to effectively disseminate accurate information and increase the health literacy of parents of young 
	  children so that they can provide better care.
